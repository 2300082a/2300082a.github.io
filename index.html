        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi I'm Irvin Ng. I'm currently a TP student interning at ASTAR.</p>
        <h2>About ASTAR</h2>
        <p>ASTAR is a research agency that is publicly funded by the Singapore Government.
        ASTAR does research across many different fields from Biomedical Science to Physical Science and 
        Engineering. I'm interning under the Cybersecurity department of I2R. I2R is the research institute
        under ASTAR that focuses on Infocomm and Communications Technology
        </p>
        <h2>Projects I'm assigned to</h2>
        <p>
         I'm currently assigned to 2 projects. The first project is as a QA for a
         currently internal ASTAR project and the other is a more public project
         which is working on the CakeML compiler. This digital portfolio would focus
         more on the public work that's done.
        </p>

        <h2>Work 1</h2>
        <p>For the public work on the CakeML compiler you can see my github history at
          https://github.com/CakeML/cakeml/commits?author=ordinarymath. Most of this work
          was done on the was working on a branch that recently got merged in this PR
          https://github.com/CakeML/cakeml/pull/1199. CakeML depends on 
          the HOL-Theorem-Prover and I have also done some work there
          https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL/commits?author=ordinarymath
          I have also done some internal work which is not publicly viewable.
       </p>
       <h2>Work 2</h2>
       <p> For the other non public work it involved writing tests using PyTest. 
        https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/. Pytest is a python framework for writing test.
        I had to learn about stuff like fixtures which allows one to create reusable setups
        for test.

    <section id="reflection">
        <h2>What have I learnt task 1</h2>
        <p>
          As CakeML is formally verified using the HOL4 theorem prover https://hol-theorem-prover.org/
          and I had to learn how to use it. I had already learnt before my internship started.
          This involved asking people who knew how to use HOL4 some working at ASTAR, some
          overseas. There were also some online resources which were useful when I was learning
          which are the https://hol-theorem-prover.org/cheatsheet.html and the description manual 
          http://sourceforge.net/projects/hol/files/hol/trindemossen-1/trindemossen-1-description.pdf/download
        </p>
        <h2>How the CakeML compiler is verified and what does it mean to be verified(technical)</h2>
        <p>
        CakeML is a verified compiler. A compiler is a program that turns code written in a programming language
        to assembly code that runs on a computer. This translation is important to be correct as without that
        bugs may occur. Software verification is the process of proving using mathematics that a software
        specifies some specification. For a compiler the specification that people want to prove is semantics
        preservation. This means that the program behaves the same. Intuitively one may think of it
        similar to how 2 * 3 is the same as 2 + 2 + 2 as they both equal the same output, 6.
